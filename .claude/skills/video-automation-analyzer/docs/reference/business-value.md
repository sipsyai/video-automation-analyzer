## Executive Summary

Video Automation Analyzer transforms screen recordings into executable automation scripts, reducing the time and cost of automation discovery, documentation, and implementation by up to 80%.

## Value Proposition

### Traditional Approach
1. Business analyst watches recordings (2-4 hours)
2. Document manual steps (2-3 hours)
3. Developer implements automation (8-16 hours)
4. QA tests and refines (4-8 hours)

**Total**: 16-31 hours per workflow

### With Video Automation Analyzer
1. Record workflow (10-15 minutes)
2. AI analyzes and generates scripts (5-10 minutes)
3. Developer reviews and refines (1-2 hours)
4. QA tests (1-2 hours)

**Total**: 2-4 hours per workflow

**Time Savings**: 75-87% reduction

## Use Cases
